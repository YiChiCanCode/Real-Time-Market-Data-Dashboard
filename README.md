Real-Time Market Data Dashboard
A comprehensive dashboard that provides real-time market data. This project is divided into several phases, as described below.

Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning
1.1 Backend Setup (Java, Spring Boot)
Create a New Project: Use Spring Initializr or your preferred IDE (like IntelliJ or Eclipse) to create a new Spring Boot project.
Choose Dependencies: Select JPA, Web, and WebSocket dependencies.
Database Setup: Configure a database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL and connect it via Spring JPA.
1.2 Frontend Setup (React or Angular)
Create a New Project: Use Create React App or Angular CLI to create your frontend project.
Select Libraries: Choose charting libraries like Chart.js or Highcharts for displaying market data.
Phase 2: Backend Development
2.1 Market Data API Integration
Choose a Market Data API: Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, etc.
Create a Service Class: Use Spring's RestTemplate or WebClient to fetch data from the API.
Model the Data: Create POJOs that model the response from the API.
2.2 WebSocket Configuration
Configure WebSocket: Use Spring's WebSocket support to push real-time updates to clients.
Create Endpoints: Define the endpoints that the frontend can subscribe to for real-time updates.
2.3 JPA Configuration
Create Entities: Define entities that mirror the market data.
Create Repositories: Use Spring JPA to create repositories for CRUD operations.
Phase 3: Frontend Development
3.1 UI Design
Create Components: Divide your dashboard into components (e.g., charts, tables).
Styling: Use CSS or a library like Bootstrap to style the components.
3.2 Data Fetching
REST API Calls: Fetch initial data from your backend using REST API calls.
WebSocket Subscription: Subscribe to the real-time endpoints provided by your backend.
3.3 Dynamic UI
Update Components: Update the UI components dynamically with the data fetched.
Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
4.1 Testing
Write Tests: Write unit and integration tests for both backend and frontend.
Use Testing Frameworks: JUnit and Mockito for Java; Jest and React Testing Library for React.
4.2 Deployment
Package Backend: Package the Java application as a JAR or WAR.
Build Frontend: Build the frontend project.
Deploy: Deploy both parts to your preferred hosting, like AWS, Azure, or a traditional web host.
Phase 5: Documentation & Maintenance
Document: Write documentation for your API and how to use the dashboard.
Monitor & Update: Keep an eye on the performance, fix bugs, and implement additional features as needed.
